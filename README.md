# Boston Housing Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Boston Housing dataset**. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions on how to load, clean, and analyze the dataset to uncover insights related to housing prices in Boston.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* openpyxl (for reading Excel files)

To install the required libraries, you can use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install them individually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
```

## Dataset

The notebook uses the **Boston Housing dataset**, which contains information about various features of homes in the Boston area and their corresponding median house values.

The dataset is read from an Excel file named `BostonHousing.xlsx`.

## Steps Covered in the Notebook

1. **Load Dataset and Basic Information**
   The first step involves loading the dataset and performing an initial inspection. We check for missing values, data types, and other basic information about the dataset.

2. **Data Exploration**
   Explore the various features in the dataset, such as crime rates, average number of rooms, property tax rates, and more.

3. **Visualization**
   Visualize the data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to uncover trends and patterns in the housing data.

4. **Data Cleaning (if necessary)**
   Handle missing values, outliers, and other potential issues in the dataset.
